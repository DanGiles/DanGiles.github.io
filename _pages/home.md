Senior Research Fellow in Machine Learning for Weather and Climate Science at University College London. Theme lead for UCL's Met Office Academic Partnership. My research interests focus on the intersection of data-driven approaches with high performance computing techniques in the area of atmospheric and ocean modelling.


Education
======
* Ph.D in Applied and Computational Mathematics, University College Dublin, Oct. 2017 - Jan. 2021
* B.Sc. in Theoretical Physics, University College Dublin, Sep. 2013 - May. 2017

Work experience
======
* Senior Research Fellow in Machine Learning for Weather and Climate, AI Centre, Department of Computer Sciences, University College London, Oct. 2023 - present
  * Acting deputy group leader of the Sustainability and Machine Learning Group.
  * Oversee and manage ongoing research projects.
  * Collaborate with various international research groups. 
  * Co-supervise PhD students within the Departments of Statistical Sciences and Computer Science.
  * Lead the “Tools, Systems and Practices” Met Office Academic Partnership (MOAP) working group. 
  * Supervise BSc and MSc students.
  * Teach as a guest lecturer for MSc modules.

* Senior Research Software Engineer/Data Scientist, Centre of Advanced Research Computing (ARC), University College London, Jan. 2023 - Oct. 2023
  * Managed ARC's involvement in the UCL Centre of Digital Innovation (CDI). The UCL CDI is a collaborative initiative between UCL and AWS. Performed technical needs assessments and developed data processing pipelines for start-ups within the CDI Impact Accelerator programme. Worked with and supported the PhD funded researchers.
  * Led a project involving the optimisation of a cosmological code designed to run on peta-scale machines. The optimisation of the codebase involved implementing architecture aware mapping of distributed memory computations.
  * Managed assistant research software engineers.

* Research Fellow, Department of Statistical Sciences, University College London, Feb. 2021 - Jan. 2023
  * Developed an open source data assimilation software package which implements particle filtering techniques and has applications in atmospheric and tsunami modelling (Julia). 
  * Collaborated with a UK Met Office partner to improve the representation of high resolution information within the Unified Model for climate predictions. 
  * Partnered with AON (reinsurance) to develop real-time approaches for providing historical context to severe weather events. 
  * Developed the numerical software on a project funded by AON (reinsurance) titled: “Production-level Cascadia tsunami hazard model incorporating far-field sources”. 
  * Co-supervised a student's MSc project focusing on developing machine learning approaches to predict atmospheric indices from real observations.
  * Associate Member of the Centre of Advanced Research Computing (ARC)

* Postgraduate Research Scholar, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University College Dublin, Oct. 2017 - Jan. 2021
  * Lead developer of a tsunami modelling software package optimised to utilise the latest high performance computing architectures
  * Created novel automated techniques which predict local variability of tsunami impact using transfer functions and machine learning methods.
  * Coupled a fast tsunami solver with a statistical emulator to provide tsunami warnings with associated uncertainties.
  * Vice-President of the SIAM-IMA Dublin Area Student Chapter


* Research Scholar, Department of Numerical Modelling, Paul Scherrer Institute (ETH Zurich), May. 2017 - Aug. 2017
  * Modelling of fluid flows in nuclear reactors with an emphasis on implementing particle tracking techniques to track radionuclides
  * Supervisor: Professor Bojan Niceno

* Research Scholar, Mathematics Applications Consortium for Science and Technology, University of Limerick, May. 2016 - Aug. 2016
  * Developed a mathematical model for predicting influential spreaders in complex networks and tested its performance by developing Python code and using idealised Erdos-R\'enyi graphs
  * Supervisor: Professor James Gleeson
