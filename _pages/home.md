* Senior Research Software Engineer/Data Scientist, Centre of Advanced Research Computing (ARC), University College London, Jan. 2023 - Oct. 2023
  * Developer for the UCL/AWS Centre of Digital innovation (CDI). Built open-source data processing pipelines on AWS resources for startups within the cohort. Worked with and supported the PhD funded researchers.
  * Project lead for the optimisation of a massively parallelised cosmology code (DiRAC SWIFT). Project involves mapping computing processes to physical cores to minimise latency.
  * Line manager for Junior Research Software Engineer

* Research Fellow, Department of Statistical Sciences, University College London, Feb. 2021 - Jan. 2023
  * Core developer of an open source data assimilation software package which implements particle filtering techniques and has applications in atmospheric and tsunami modelling
  * Initiated an ongoing collaboration with a UK Met Office partner to improve the representation of high resolution information within the Unified Model for climate predictions.
  * Partnered with AON (reinsurance) and the Met Office to develop real-time approaches for providing historical context to severe weather events.
  * Developed the numerical software on a joint project with AON titled: “Production-level Cascadia tsunami hazard model incorporating far-field sources”.
  * Academic mentoring of two PhD students. Support focused on high performance computing methods, the implementation of statistical learning techniques and the running of climate models.
  * Associate Member of the Centre of Advanced Research Computing (ARC)

* Postgraduate Research Scholar, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University College Dublin, Oct. 2017 - Jan. 2021
  * Lead developer of a tsunami modelling software package optimised to utilise the latest high performance computing architectures
  * Created novel automated techniques which predict local variability of tsunami impact using transfer functions and machine learning methods.
  * Coupled a fast tsunami solver with a statistical emulator to provide tsunami warnings with associated uncertainties.
  * Vice-President of the SIAM-IMA Dublin Area Student Chapter


* Research Scholar, Department of Numerical Modelling, Paul Scherrer Institute (ETH Zurich), May. 2017 - Aug. 2017
  * Modelling of fluid flows in nuclear reactors with an emphasis on implementing particle tracking techniques to track radionuclides
  * Supervisor: Professor Bojan Niceno

* Research Scholar, Mathematics Applications Consortium for Science and Technology, University of Limerick, May. 2016 - Aug. 2016
  * Developed a mathematical model for predicting influential spreaders in complex networks and tested its performance by developing Python code and using idealised Erdos-R\'enyi graphs
  * Supervisor: Professor James Gleeson
