## Abstract 
Parameterisation schemes within General Circulation Models are required to capture cloud processes and precipitation formation but exhibit long-standing known biases. Here, we develop a hybrid approach that tackles these biases by embedding a Multi-Output Gaussian Process trained to predict high resolution variability within each climate model grid box. The trained multi-output Gaussian Process model is coupled in-situ with a simplified Atmospheric General Circulation Model named SPEEDY. The temperature and specific humidity profiles of SPEEDY are perturbed at fixed intervals according to the variability predicted from the Gaussian Process. Ten-year predictions are generated for both control and machine learning hybrid models. The hybrid model reduces the global precipitation area-weighted root-mean squared error by up to 17% and over the tropics by up to 20%. Hybrid techniques have been known to introduce non-physical states therefore physical quantities are explored to ensure that climatic drift is not observed. Furthermore, to understand the drivers of the precipitation improvements the changes to thermodynamic profiles and the distribution of lifted index values are investigated.
