## Abstract 
This report was commissioned by the Met Office to scope and shape the Met Office Transatlantic Data Science Academy (TDSA). The proposed Academy aims to provide technical training, learning and development, and career development for UK-based data scientists, data engineers, data assimilation scientists, and research software engineers working in the field of Earth Observation (while maintaining alignment with US colleagues at NOAA and NOAA partner affiliates). Further aims are to increase the diversity of staff and students working in these areas, provide the necessary support to staff and students to sustain such an increase in diversity and provide motivating careers and career opportunities for staff and students throughout their early, mid- and late careers, while ensuring an effective balance between on-the-job learning, peer-to-peer learning and formal training. Equity, diversity and inclusion are central to the approach of the project team, both in our recommendations for shaping the Academy and in the way we have carried out the project. The team have consulted as widely as possible via the mechanisms of an online stakeholder workshop (56 attendees), by conducting interviews and by reviewing existing literature. Addressing the identified gaps in learning, development, and career framework provision for TDSA roles requires a collaborative effort involving academia, research institutions, professional organisations, and funding bodies. By providing learners with ideas for personal development, signposting existing courses, developing specialised training programmes, improving accessibility, improving learner support mechanisms and establishing clearer career pathways, we can empower a diverse group of current and future professionals with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their fields and contribute to advancements in atmospheric science and Earth Observation.
